# 3dna2

Generate printable 3D models from sequenced gnome data.

3dna2 is a successor of [3dna](), my first attempt at creating printable models from raw 23andme genome data.  3dna2 is designed to create models that represent the genome in a more meaningful way, as well as simplifying the user experience of the tool.

The goal of 3dna2 is to provide a service or application anyone can use to generate, view and print a model based on their genome data from any popular sequencing service.  Generated models can be visualized electronically, exported for printing at home or ordered from online 3D printing services.
